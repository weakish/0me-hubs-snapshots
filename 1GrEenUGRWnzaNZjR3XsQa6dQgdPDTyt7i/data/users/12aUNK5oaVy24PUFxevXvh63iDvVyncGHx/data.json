I'd rather not host a full zeronet proxy but I had a similar idea to you where there was a bridge to create a new zeroid profile to comment with (perhaps even using OAuth) and whenever someone comments, a little program runs in the background to update the relevant users.json file. If the person wanted, they could get access to the private key of their user id to directly comment via zeronet. Otherwise, they'd be able to comment via my proxy. The only problem with this system is that I would have access to the zeroid private key myself - although I suppose that's not much different from using disqus or a similar system.",
