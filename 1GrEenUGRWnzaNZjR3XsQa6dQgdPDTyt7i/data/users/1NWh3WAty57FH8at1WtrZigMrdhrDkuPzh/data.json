As Nofish mentions, it seems to be ~164 now. I imagine the popularity comes from being an active ZeroNet user (on zerotalk, zerome, and my own blog), being a girl, and being the developer of Kaffiene, which is pretty popular as it is.\n\nI gotta say, makes me feel loved though :D",

But if it's all girls, then you'd go with girls/ladies/etc. I don't think I've ever seen 'guys' used to describe an all girl group. But it's definitely possible. A guy is a man, but guys can either be a group of all men, or a gender-mixed group. If you say something like 'the guys' it generally means all men.",
