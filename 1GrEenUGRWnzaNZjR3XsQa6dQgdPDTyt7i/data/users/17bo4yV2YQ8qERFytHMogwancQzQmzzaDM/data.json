And the site they advertise in the giveaway, purse.io, is pretty neat, and at least relevant to people interested in bitcoin-based services like ZeroNet.",

I used to live in Ohio, one of the many states that is used as a massive dump of tax dollars for subsidized corn farming, and the damage caused by soil erosion due to the farming of exclusively shallow-rooting crops is astounding, in the worst ways. IMO there's very little in the way of a logical argument that can be made in the case of livestock agriculture of the scale on which it exists today, in the developed world. ",
