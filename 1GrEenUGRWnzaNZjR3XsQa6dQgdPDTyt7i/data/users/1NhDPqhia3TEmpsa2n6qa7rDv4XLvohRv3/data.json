I'm thinking that i'll have posts timeout after so long without reply, which will delete them from the network. Once i have a working version, it'll be just /b/. but i'll add more boards afterwords. But considering how small the zeronet population is at the moment, I think one board is plenty.",

I'm interested in doing this for a few reasons.\n\n- Bored.\n- I don't really like the forums that are currently on zero\n- I want to see what this network can do.\n\nOther than that, no goals. It will likely go its own way before i'm satisfied with it.\nwill be at least a few weeks before I have a working copy. \n\nI will likely have mods elected should that need arise. I'm going to have minimum rules. Obviously no illegal content. Other than that, I don't care.\n\n\nAnd I'm not the best person with designing webpages. I'm good with the back end code though, so that should be pretty good.",
