			"body": "The first things we make take a lot of time and effort with small reward. I cloned Flappy Bird and took a week to upgrade it. Then a week to clone Nullpaste and add an editor. Then perhaps a month making a more modular app frontend. But the new frontend let's me take github content and launch it with add-on features in a few days. Starting with existing open source and building from there reduces dev time enormously. Provide the original sources and people can see what you've added. As @Shellbound says, the next step is collaboration on ZN apps to speed the process even more.",
