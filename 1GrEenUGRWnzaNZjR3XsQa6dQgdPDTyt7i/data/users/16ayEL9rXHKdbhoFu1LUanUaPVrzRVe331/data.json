			"body": "It uses your phone number as a username, so as long as you can do one time SMS based authentication then you can sign up. Using any burner app for mobile phones or VOIP service works. Ultimately it's still a centralized system and isn't perfect in it's requirements to run (Google Apps...) but it's user friendly and easy to suggest to others. Wire is another solution though not very well known at the moment, as is matrix. And Tox/Antox is fully decentralized, p2p and e2e encrypted, though uses quite a bit of battery since the phone is both a client and a server (one reason while zeronet on mobile might be tricky).",
