And you want to collect and share indian music because you can't find and download it from internet. I am not sure it is what you meant but I tried to describe what I understood from your message. Or did you mean you want to create/compose your own music in indian stile? P.S. I can't understand french language, and I do not have any translators. G??gle makes no sense.",

You can question person who tries to blame you. In case of success you do not even need to chose to ask forgiveness or not... \"Provoking feeling of guilt\" - nice idea for post me to write.",
