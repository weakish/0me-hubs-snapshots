If that could be done then that would be perfect as I hate the thought of going through 8-10k worth of songs and making text files with data for each >.<\n\nThe database code works perfectly and is based on Kafiene, just be aware though that it's artist-oriented by design, meaning the results show up as the music artist first before the actual song entry. This is intentional.\n\nAs for music streaming during download, I've got that working. The main issue with that is browser support really, as Chrome does not yet support streaming some formats with WebTorrent (not sure which though). I've heard wav works in some browsers while not in others, mp3 the same. m4a is the only one that seems to have the best browser support for streaming at the moment",

The entire NinjaBeats library is perfectly organised and is predictable, so all I really need is some code that asks for a path to a track or folder containing tracks and it would save the extracted ID tag data as variables.\n\nM4A is the MP4 audio container. It can contain AAC/AAC+ or lossless AAC, although it is most commonly used by Apple for lossy AAC @ 256kbps (the start of noticeable distortion is at 128kbps, so Apple doubles it to make sure it doesn't sound bad. However, I intentionally do it at the highest VBR offered by dbpoweramp so that it doesn't clash with Apple's music - long story short I don't want my transcodes to get mixed up with genuine Apple ones). M4As at the moment are the only lossy codec files that hasn't been polluted with crappy transcodes by people putting it at low quality or getting the ID tags wrong, so I tend to use it for searching up music online so I can get the right ID tags for music I own, as any redistributions are just left as is and are straight from the iTunes store. I do not recommend transcoding something to m4a unless you know what you're doing for this very reason.",
