			"body": "Hey guys.  Quick PSA on the status of Bwoi and myself, will try to keep this short and not too much of a rant but chances are I won't hold back.\n\nBwoi is intentionally dying at the moment, and I urge you all to find alternate solutions if you're still using it.  As of right now it's abandoned and I won't be updating it again -- which means that the index will quickly grow to become outdated as ZeroNet develops.  The site won't be taken down due to historic purposes (since I have backups of it floating around from early development) and it's nice to see how far it's come, but I feel that it has really seen the end of its days.  I was originally going to shut down the site a while back (August at some point?) but I grew ill shortly before and life got in the way a bit.  I'm fine now, of course, otherwise I wouldn't be typing this, but whatever.\n\nI won't be working on any more projects since I've basically given up.  Everything I've tried to do so far (Bwoi, ZeroTweet, BwoiVideo) has quickly been fucked over by someone else with the same/a similar idea meaning that I've just done weeks worth of work with little gain, since another service has been launched shortly before the release of a project, which is why I've moved on -- permanently -- to do something different.  I originally decided to move on to gamedev, and I'm not sure whether my mind will change, but I hope (fingers crossed) that everything goes well.\n\nWhich is why I'm moving on.  ZeroNet isn't really safe for someone like me at the moment, and it's quite difficult to develop anything of use without being overrun with \"LOL U SUCK FUCKING GET UR OWN IDEAS\" every 10 minutes as if I wanted to copy someone, for whatever reason.  Good job, you came up with a great original comment that totally hasn't been sent to me before.\n\nAnyways, might not be back for a bit, I just came up with some genuinely good ideas that hopefully won't be stolen 5 seconds before I post the URL.
