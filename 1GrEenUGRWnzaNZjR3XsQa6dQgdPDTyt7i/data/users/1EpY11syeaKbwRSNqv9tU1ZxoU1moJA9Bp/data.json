Trying to get FLV working in browsers might not be worth the hassle. 12hstudy maybe re-encoding the video via handbreak? ",

FLV doesn't defaultly support subtitles, menus, chaptering, H.264, or H.265. It's an old standard from the Adobe Flash player days. If you were going to use an Abobe format I would recommend using F4V because it actually has some compression with H.264. ",
