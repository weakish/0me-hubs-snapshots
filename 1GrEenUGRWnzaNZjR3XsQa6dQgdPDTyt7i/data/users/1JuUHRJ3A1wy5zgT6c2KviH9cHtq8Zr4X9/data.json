			"body": "@ks: People usually say that voters vote against self-interest without understanding what people actually want.  In the US, people accuse rural voters of voting against self interest for various reasons.  For one thing, rural voters tend to reject progressive policy positions.  However, in order to do so they must support republicans, who hurt them in different ways than democrats.  I don't think that ignorance captures the reason for this trade-off.  On the other hand, people in the US tend to be ignorant about political theory beyond the American model.  Plato's critique seems especially forceful this election cycle.  Democracy can be very oppressive. On the other hand, our society is likely at the point where we could live in a peaceful and prosperous anarchy.  ",

			"body": "@Durand: That's true as far as it goes, however you have to look at their choices.  Each party (or even candidate) has a bundle of policies.  Our system forces people to chose among the bundles even if all of them have negative aspects.  Candidates who want to reduce government spending (rather than move it around) do not exist.  The choice is always a difficult compromise, however it is a leap to say it is irrational.  I don't presume to know what other people value and I certainly don't want to force them to value what I value.  Maybe some people vote republican simply because they feel republican politicians are less likely to change their lives in ways they really care about.  Don't assume that people would rather have more money and less religion, tighter ATF enforcement, or whatever.",
