And also archiving it won't make possible to archive comments, because you don't know what files you have to ask for. \nSo i'm not sure if it's worth making it more complicated, but if someone wants to run an archiving node, then it's possible by simply adding the data directory to a git repository, so you can reverse it to any state.",
