I could never find a definite position in current politics and I refuse to choose from the Democratic or Republican parties. I think they are all corrupt. The only party that seems to have a good view is the Pirate Party. But I will probably never side with a given political party.\n\n\nI just read a paper on something like moral view for politic's. It was written by Immanuel Kant. He wanted to secularize morals so that there was a common ground free of corruption. It would be great if something like that was our reality instead of everything constantly being about corruption and blame games in politics.",
