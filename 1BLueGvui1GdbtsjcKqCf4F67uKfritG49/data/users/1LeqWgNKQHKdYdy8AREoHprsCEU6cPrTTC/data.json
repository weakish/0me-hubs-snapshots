(Shmoop & SparkNotes are good).\n\n- Read the Character overviews.\n\n- Read the book and pause at every section to make a note of the general theme. Write in on the page in the book.\n\n- Underline anything that resonates with you or could be useful later.\n\n- After every chapter summarize it on a post-it and put it in the book.\n\n- When finished reading the book. Try to summarize what the main points of the story were.\n\n- Read literary criticism about the book.\n\n- Write something about it.",
