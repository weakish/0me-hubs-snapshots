Are there better ways of managing bandwidth?\n\n- The most important files (content.json and index.html) are small but may be very difficult to transfer.\n  - [The mirror of The Intercept](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1MVPxVaimxnd7aKdgfJzCnUZCwEYAd3DnD/) probably never became available.\n  - New sites might take a long time to start because downloaders see `CONTENT.JSON DOWNLOAD FAILED` while uploaders see few peers accepting content.json.\n\n- Less important (but not optional) files might be large enough to disrupt page loading.\n  - [Zatogra](http://127.0.0.1:43110/zatogra.bit/) can appear empty.  It has images from data.json right on the main page.\n  - [ZeroTalk with images](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1C2JhCunGLtvyX56nQ88tcb87WnXspjWN/) has to do similar work but loads more smoothly.\n  - [KickAssTorrents](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1LBr1dHoXvJAMjDgW8Wcg5kbCoKyJnzo6p/) and [ZeroTorrent](http://127.0.0.1:43110/ZeroTorrent.bit/) have real image files which might interfere with json loading over slower connections.  Omitting them would affect comments.\n\n- Optional files might be larger than most users are willing to download.\n  - [ZeroISR](http://127.0.0.1:43110/12oGb8xBjLYz23CGJxRQyzZ6mGybZokEKt/) has over 600MB of optional files.  Some users might prefer to host only the smaller files.\n\nA tiered file organization might help.  Instead of offering the choice to \"download and help distribute all files\" (or none), the sidebar could indicate how much space is needed for particular sets of files, with a selector for which to host.  For example, ZeroTorrent might have:\n\n1. content.json, dbschema.json, index.html (required, ...kB)\n2. css, img, js (required, ...kB)\n3. user json (`mixed`, ...GB)\n   1. zerocomments (`seeding`, ...B)\n   2. zerotorrents (`optional`, ...kB)\n   3. sirenyc (`seeding`, ...MB)\n   4. spam (`downloading`, ...GB)\n4. .torrent files (`optional`, ...MB)\n5. image files (`optional`, ...MB)\n\nGroups of files higher in the list should be downloaded first.  This would give site owners better control over how file transfers are prioritized, and everyone else would have more control over how much they host.",
