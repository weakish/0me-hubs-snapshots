Manly man is smart so he can figure out how any mechanism or other thing works just by staring at it. Here is one story about that kind of guy. He and his friends were spending their free time in a forest: camp fire, alcohol, jokes, talks, fun. And then they are under attack of little flying insects seeking for blood. Mr. Manly Man uses his insect \"repellent\" cream on himself with catastrophic result. Because he did not read manual. It was saying: use this cream outside your camp on a rock or a tree, so all insects will be attracted to that spot and will not bother you.",

It is used when 1st person asks 2nd person to go somewhere and to do something there, and 2nd person acknowledge and wants to say he will do this very quickly. I think english have some equivalents - \"consider it done\" or maybe \"I will do it in a blink of an eye!\". So \"one leg here, other leg there\" means one person is so quick, so in one moment his one leg here, and in next moment he is already in other place stepping his other leg.\nHere is actually the joke. If deminer (guy who deactivates mines on a mine field) makes mistake, he can say \"one leg here, other leg there\".",

In english there is no word \"finity\" and in russian corresponding word means limb. Let me explain you details. \"Infinite\" means something without end. That is exact meaning of russian word \"beskonechiy\" (infinite), i mean something \"bes\" (without) \"konechniy\" (end). So \"beskonechnost\" is \"infinity\", but at same time \"konechnost\" in russian means \"limb\" (hand or/and leg, head maybe, I am not sure about head). So I guess now you can understand following \"play of words\".\nWhen deminer stepped on a mine, he scattered his \"finities\" and then he become \"infinity\".\nP.S. Now you can associate infinity as something without limbs...",
