			"body": "Article Translation: Inner moral vs Outer moral.\n\nЧто такое мораль и нравственность.\nWhat is outer moral and inner moral.\n\nМораль - принятая в данном конкретном обществе система норм и ценностей, призванная регламентировать взаимоотношения людей.\nOuter moral is system of norms and values accepted in specific society, which designed for regulation of people relations.\n\nНравственность - неукоснительное соблюдение человеком своих внутренних принципов, носящих при этом всеобщий, универсальный характер.\nInner moral is person's strict abidance of his own inner principles, which has property of being global, universal.\n \nСравнение морали и нравственности.\nComparison of outer moral and inner moral.\n\nВ чем же разница между моралью и нравственностью?\nWhat the difference between outer moral and inner moral?\n\nМораль и нравственность - фундаментальные философские категории, которые находятся в ведении науки этики. Но смысл, который они несут, различен. Сущность морали состоит в том, что она предписывает или запрещает конкретные людские действия или поступки. Мораль формируется социумом, а потому она всегда отвечает интересам определенной группы (национальной, религиозной и т.д.). Задумайтесь, даже у преступных кланов есть своя мораль! При этом им обязательно противостоит другая часть общества - со своими устоями и нормами, а из этого следует, что моралей одномоментно может быть великое множество. Обычно мораль зафиксирована в законе (кодексе), в котором закреплены определенные нормы поведения. Каждый поступок человека согласно данному закону оценивается обществом негативно или позитивно. Интересно, что в одном и том же социуме мораль может со временем измениться до неузнаваемости (как, например, произошло в России в XX веке), диктуя прямо противоположные принципы поведения.\nOuter and inner moral are fundamental philosophical categories, which are subjects of ethics science. But meaning of those two words has differences. Essence of outer moral is to dictate and forbid specific human actions and doings. Outer moral is forming/creating by society, and because of that it is always serves for interests of specific group of people (national group, religious group and so on). Think about it, even criminal clans have their own outer moral! And at same time this criminal group is necessarily opposed by other part of society which has it's traditions and norms, and what is follows from that is there can be very big number of \"outer moral\"s at same time. Usually outer moral established in The Law (Codex), in which specific norms of behavior are fixated. Every deed of person is judjed as negative or positive by that law/codex. It is interesting, in the same society outer moral can change in time to unrecognisable state (as, for example, what happened in Russia in 20th century), dictating antithetic (quite opposite) principles of behavior.\n\nOтличие морали от нравственности.\nDifference of outer moral and inner moral.\n\nНравственность же неизменна по содержанию и крайне проста по форме. Она абсолютна и выражает интересы человека (и человечества) в целом. Одними из главных нравственных ориентиров считаются отношение к другому, как к самому себе, и любовь к ближнему, а значит, нравственность изначально не приемлет насилия, презрения, унижения, ущемления чьих-либо прав. Наиболее нравственно поступает тот человек, который совершает нравственные поступки, даже об этом не задумываясь. Он просто не может вести себя по-другому. Мораль направлена в первую очередь на самоутверждение, а нравственность - на бескорыстный интерес к другому человеку. Нравственность наиболее близка к идеалу, к универсуму.\nInner moral is unchangable in it's content and very simple in it's form/shape. It is absolute and express interests of person (and humanity) in common. One of main reference points of inner moral is: attitude for other person as if you dealing with yourself, love for close people, and this means that inner moral from beginning doesn't allow violence, contempt, humiliation, limiting of someone's rights. Most \"inner moral\" person is person who do \"inner moral\" deeds, even without thinking about it. This person can't behave other way. Outer moral directed (in 1st place) for self-affirmation, but inner moral - for non-selfish/non-profitable interest to other person. Inner moral more close to the ideal, to universum.\n\nОтличие морали от нравственности.\nDifferences between outer moral and inner moral.\n\nНравственность связана с духовной, а мораль - с социальной сферой.\nInner moral is related to spiritual/mind sphere, outer moral is related to social sphere.\n\nНравственности свойственно постоянство, мораль же крайне изменчива.\nInner moral tend to be solid/unchangable, Outer moral is very changable.\n\nНравственность едина для всех, а моральных устоев великое множество.\nInner moral is one for all, but there are big number of \"outer moral\"s.\n\nНравственные устои абсолютны, а моральные - условны (зависят от места и времени).\nInner moral is absolute, but outer moral is relative (from place to place and from time to time).\n\nМораль стремится соответствовать некому образцу (обычно где-то прописанному), нравственность основывается на <внутреннем законе>.\nOuter moral tends to match some image (usually written somewhere), inner moral based on \"inner law/order\".\n",
