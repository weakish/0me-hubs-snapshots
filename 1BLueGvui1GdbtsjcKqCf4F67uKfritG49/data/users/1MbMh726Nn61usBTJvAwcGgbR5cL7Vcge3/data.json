But when I discover them, I've found that really those events are pretty irrelevant to me... and irrelevant to most people. The major events e.g. human crises (war refugees etc), which require large-scale attention for humanitarian help, could be helped by those local to the crisis - which would happen, were those people not totally locked down by their news and media sources. \n\nI also have so much more time available to learn and grow as a person, becoming more able to be part of and help the community I live in. Media and News keep us distracted from practically everything, instigating deep stagnation of personal growth and community connections.\n\nWhat do you think about reddit as a news source? I've been explaining and recommending it to friends and family as a pretty balanced, \"unbiased\" news source, but I've come across some things recently suggesting the boards are moderated in the interests of those running reddit (and/or moderators of subs). If not reddit, what similar sites could I recommend?\n\nThanks for the website link :) ",
