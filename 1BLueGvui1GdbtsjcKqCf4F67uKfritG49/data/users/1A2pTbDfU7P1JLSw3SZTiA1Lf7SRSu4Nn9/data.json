Then use (careful) iptables -P INPUT DROP && standard related established allowed, icmp allow, then iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s 42.42.42.1/12 -j ACCEPT and the same for -p udp, that is accept only that IP-range/subnet. or add more of these \"subnet allowed\" lists. In short: do the filtering on range of IP, or lists of IP, with iptables, and let the tracker think its doing fine.",
