			"body": "@Truth: yeah, heard about the multiuser plugin but I'm not going to bother, ZeroTorrent isn't going to be active for much longer anyway, I'll be saving my efforts for something more stable.\n\n@Sirenyc: I hear ya, buddy. There are already several other index sites on Zeronet but I'm thinking about much grander scales. I am envisioning the cooperative building of a vast digital non-profit \"Doomsday Vault\" for literally ALL active torrents on ALL public trackers, there's roughly about 60 million of them at last count. From movies to tv shows to music to games to books/comics to apps to you-name-it, if they're not dead yet they get lovingly indexed and made available to everybody, forever. This is quickly becoming a mission critical issue as DMCA takedowns have recently really started to ramp up and with TPP looming on the horizon things are only going to get worse, the fall of KAT and Torrentz.eu is merely the prologue. \n\nTherefore, I am proposing that We, the Free and Noble Netizens of Zeronet, pool our varied talents and resources together and make this happen. For my part, I can help harvest, process and upload the relevant materials, you and several others can do the same. But we also need Zeronet-savvy programmers to actually help build this Vault and keep it operational, netsec pros to keep it safe, graphic designers to brand and adorn it and an army of moderators to keep everything running smoothly. It would need to be a community effort in every way.\n",
