			"body": "Okay so I had what I think is an amazingly amazing idea.\n\nKaffie wants a video site but video sites can't really work because they require so much storage or you have to have someone as the host and they can't go offline.\n\nThen Kaffie suggested a music site where you all listen to music together but I'm not a huge fan because it relies on you all liking the same music. \n\nSo I was thinking about what I do like doing with people and I realised that I like watching films and shows with people.\n\nSo it hit me, we make a site where you watch things with people. One person starts a room and then they invite people and the host picks a file on their computer to watch and webtorrents it to everyone else in the room so they can all stream it live together.  You can all chat and interact if you want or you can just watch the thing and chat afterwards.\n\nIt could potentially also have the option to embed streams from normal websites so you can watch other things together. It could even do music as well just to make everyone happy.\n\nEveryone gets the file but nobody has to store anything indefinitely because you're only watching it once and you're all watching it at the same time. At the end, the host deletes the room you were in and it's like it never happened.\n\nI feel like this would either be a reasonable success or nobody would ever use it and it would be cringingly empty. Either way at least it's an idea in this time of needing ideas.",

I kind of want a exclusive site though that only selected people can post to so that there can be rigorous quality control and no bad torrents can be shared.\n\nI think the reddit alternative might bring people. There needs to be moderators on the subforums to stop shitposts taking over but there also needs to be a way to stop people abusing it so there could be a public log of what they do and anyone could make an alternative sub anyway and move there if the mods are bad.\n\nThe most important thing is community, whatever sites we have. Even if they are small, as long as they offer something to someone then people will come seek them out. That's why reddit is so good, all the little communities that you can't find elsewhere easily.\n\nI don't really know what people want though, I'm not even sure what I want.",
