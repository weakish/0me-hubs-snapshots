That doesn't make them not open or bad for the jobs they were designed for. Epub is designed for reflowing text on e-ink readers and for that, it does an amazing job.",

Some problems, like distribution, can be make cheaper through newer technologies but the bulk of the cost is in actually writing and producing that book. There are [alternative book publishers](https://www.versobooks.com/) out there which publish books DRM-free but they are still yet to take off. I think the main reason for this is that established authors don't know enough about DRM and the industry to make an informed decision so they leave it up to their publishers.",
