First of all take the digestion of politics, it usually ends up with users consuming news that is aligned with their current position or one they see as favorable. Unless they are in a transition phase.\n\nMy problem with politics, is I can't find a definite position, so I can't find the ultimate good. I can only find positions that support my interests, and often as in nature it comes at the expense of others. Does everybody's politics just favor their own interest or is their a higher purpose? An ultimate good? A side of politics that can be as certain as Algebra? ",
