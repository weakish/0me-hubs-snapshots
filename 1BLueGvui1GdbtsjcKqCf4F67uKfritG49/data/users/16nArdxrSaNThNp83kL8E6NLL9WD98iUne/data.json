Darker blues are my personal favorites, despite what DZM's current theme might suggest, but I scrapped blue because it has a tendency to disappear when using screen tinters like \"f.lux\". The original purpose of DZM was, as it's name suggests, to provide a Dark mode for people in dim environments, or for nighttime viewing. Sadly, your suggested color scheme doesn't fit with those requirements.\n\nThough I suppose I could create a separate T/B themed ZeroMe, but it isn't a priority at the moment.\n\nAs for going material theme, that's even more work, but sounds interesting. However, again, not a priority for me right now.",

So I have to look at and understand how and why \"all.js\" does things before I can start making major changes.\n\nMy goal isn't to make a new ZeroMe front-end, I sadly don't have the time to support that.

It doesn't really matter which hub you're on, as inevitably people will eventually have all of them downloaded anyway, just by browsing ZeroMe.\n\n\nBasically the Hubs act as separate databases where the user data is stored separately from ZeroMe. This helps provide a solution to the issue where users could run out of allowed space on a site, like ZeroTorrents, and not be allowed to post anything more because of it. The separation of the hubs on sites like ZeroMe means that even if you run out of space on one hub, you can move to a new hub and continue posting. Your posts and comments will still be tied to your account, just stored in a different hub, and they'll all appear in ZeroMe as long as you have the hubs downloaded.\n\n\nAnother benefit of the separation of the hubs from the site itself is that the original site isn't the only one that can use the hubs. This basically means that sites like ZeroMe are basically front-ends to the hubs, which also means that you can use different front-ends and still access the same data. Think of it like third-party Twitter clients on your phone. They each function differently, with different UIs and features, but they all connect to the same Twitter APIs and databases. So basically people can create their own modified ZeroMe sites, but still talk to people using the original ZeroMe.",
