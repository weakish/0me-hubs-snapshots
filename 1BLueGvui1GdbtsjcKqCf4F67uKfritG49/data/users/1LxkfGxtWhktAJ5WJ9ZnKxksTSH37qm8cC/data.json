It calls back the `onfinish` function when it is done. You can load the blob into a PDF. Don't forget to change the blob content type. Instructions can be found in the docs.\n- - -\nBtw, It seems that you are including the `daemon.js`. You don't need that file if you are not working with videos, since `daemon.js` is sort of a background worker that appends data to the **video** Source Buffer. If anything does not work, feel free to mention me and tell me about it.",

More specifically, you just need to modify `events.otherParams = {\"blobType\": \"application/pdf\"};` and the `showPlayer` function. The `url` parameter is the blob url.",
