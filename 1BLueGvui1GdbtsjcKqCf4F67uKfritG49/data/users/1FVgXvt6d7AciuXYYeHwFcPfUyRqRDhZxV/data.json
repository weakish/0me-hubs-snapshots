The nature of downloading and caching each site would make browsing actually manageable. You obviously couldn't upload or seed anything, but I'm not even sure it would be fast enough to sync anything in a reasonable amount of time. You might be stuck with 5min sync delays, assuming the connection didn't just do a timeout from the start, but it'd be usable if you don't have anything else. \n\nNow I wish I had a landline or wireless modem left to test this with. Damn progress, always getting in the way of curiosity.",
