			"body": "I just canceled my contract with EDF (the major electricity provider in France),  their website is incredibly... Waouh.\nI started with a password reset. You can simply reset it using a \"security question\". You know, a question that looks like \"where are you born ?\". Yes. **I can cancel electricity to anyone by knowing its email adress and its bornplace.**\nThen, I get a password reset link by email. But there were two links: _\"reset password using a computer or a tablet\"_ and _\"reset password using a smartphone\"_. I guess they never heard about responsive design.\nAfter that, I had to reset my password. I tried _QBDojuq06RSAB0aibAZy_. But it was just a \"correct password\". Because, for \"security reason\", I must add a special character. Yes, they are talking about security but I can steal the account of anyone I want, and I can't have a password longer than 20 chars.\n\nI make a small aside, but... Why some website restrict password length? Ok, forbid small passwords can be cool to avoid bruteforce, but what about long passwords ? Anyway, it is hashed so it has a fixed size in database. So the **only** difference between a 20 chars password and a 128 chars password is that the 128 one is more secure.\n\nThis form was also awful. It violates about 4 rules explained [here (clearnet link)](https://uxdesign.cc/design-better-forms-96fadca0f49c), even if it contains only 2 inputs.\n\nSo, when I finally get into my account, I clicked the relocation link and then I... had to signin again.\n\nWell, it's impressive to see how an enterprise that have a great impact on the life of its customers can do such mistakes",

Actually I didn't evene known I was using it because it was installed with Gnome. Today I think the fact that there is no official frontend (except the ones bundled with window managers) made it awful.\n\nThen I used **wicd** for about 3 years. It was very buggy: sometimes you have to restart the service, the autoconnect option is awfully slow (about 5 minutes sometimes), the absence of documentation (try the command `man wicd-cli`: you should see `DESCRIPTION TODO  :-)`) and the frontends that crashes randomly (see wicd-curses that crash on refresh and wicd-gtk which process stay alive even if you close the window).\n\nSince about 6 months I'm using **connman** and I'm perfectly happy with it: very fast, with a well documented manual (I managed to make a full configuration for a very specific network 10 minutes thanks to it, while hours of internet researches were useless when I was using wicd and NetworkManager) and several pretty frontend. The only drawback is that some networks need to be managed in command line or by editing configuration files.",
