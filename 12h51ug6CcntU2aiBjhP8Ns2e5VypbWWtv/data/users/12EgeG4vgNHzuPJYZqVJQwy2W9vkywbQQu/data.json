			"body": "Please stop with the crap about Microsoft apparently breathing over your shoulder spying on everything. Unlike Google they're not any significant online advertising company and can do very little with your info if they wanted it (from a profit perspective). Microsoft is pushing for Win10 because they can get continuous revenue from a percentage of purchases made on the Windows 10 Store and their services like Groove Music, Microsoft Films & TV, Xbox and all that. They have been using telemetry since Windows Vista to help shape their products and on 10 they just made it more clear to consumers. If they genuinely wanted to spy on people they wouldn't make them available as options on their own dedicated \"Privacy\" tab on the front page of the settings app.\n- See this for details on the realities of this hoax: https://imgur.com/gallery/oQDnY",
