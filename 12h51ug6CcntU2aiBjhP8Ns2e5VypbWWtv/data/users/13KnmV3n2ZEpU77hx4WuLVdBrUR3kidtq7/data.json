Of course, they are not fully trained doctors, but they must have the basic knowledge about pharmacology. So unless your medication can be used in a wide variety of cases, they would know more or less what you need it for. But they are professionals. And they deal with patients all day long, so that people who visit them are having a condition is the more or less the normal case, except for those that come only for something against their cold. Oh, and of course they should also be polite, you're their client. ",
