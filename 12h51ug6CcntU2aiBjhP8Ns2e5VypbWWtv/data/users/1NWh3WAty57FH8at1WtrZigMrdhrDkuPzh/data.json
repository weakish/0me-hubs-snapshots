			"body": "Alright, so everything seems to be in order for my new awesome hub and cleanly migrating hubs for those of you who want to switch to my hub, or the infinity one (or even Red->Blue/Blue->Red for you color traitors).\n\nFirst things first is to seed the new hub you want to switch to. You're likely already seeding Red and Blue, but you'll need to seed the [Kaffie hub](/12h51ug6CcntU2aiBjhP8Ns2e5VypbWWtv) or the infinity hub, if you want to switch to those. If you're seeing this post, you should already have the Kaffie hub.\n\nDon't bother going to the 'create profile' page. That's for suckers. It's nice to check which subs you're seeding, but the 'create profile' button just messes things up. Instead, go to your home sub (you can figure out what this is by hovering over your name and looking at the URL) and go into the /data/users/[your id]/ folder. You'll want to copy over this whole folder into the new hub's equivalent.\n\nIn the destination hub, open up content.json in a text editor (like sublime, so formatting doesn't get messed up). All you want to do is edit 'address' to point to the new hub, instead of your old one.\n\nNext, open up data.json in the destination hub. You'll see all your original hub data. Here's what we're going to do. Delete all of the entries under 'comments'. These are comments relating to the hub they're in, so you don't need them migrated. You should still keep the array though, since that's where all your new hub comments will go.\n\nChange the 'hub' to the new hub you're migrating to. Just like you did in the content.json. This is a reference to say what your 'home hub' is. We'll eventually edit this in EVERY hub you're seeding or posted in, but one step at a time.\n\nChange 'next_comment_id' to 1. Since we deleted the comments, we need to reset the counter.\n\nHere's where you get a choice. There's two options for your posts. Either you can migrate the data, which switches the name link on those posts (and hosts it in the new hub) but also unlink everyone's comments, or you can leave the posts in the old hub, and start fresh. If you start fresh, your old posts will still appear, but they'll link back to your old hub profile. So keep that in mind. I personally started fresh.\n\nTo start fresh, do the same thing to your posts as you did your comments. Delete all the entries and change the 'next_post_id' to 1.\n\nLastly, delete everything under 'post_like'. Keep the array though.\n\nThat should set up your new hub account. Now we need to repoint your data on the other hubs. For each hub you've posted in, go into that hub's folder and find your user folder, like we did before.\n\nOn each one, open the data.json and simply edit the 'hub' variable to point to your home hub. This is probably optional (as it repoints the comment links), but I went ahead and did it to reduce the amount of problems.\n\nOn your original sub, a couple more things need to be tweaked. Delete everything under 'follows'. Remove the variable entirely. Delete 'next_follow_id' as well. Change 'hub' to your new hub, as usual. And if you opted to migrate your posts, delete the entire 'posts' section along with the 'next_post_id' variable. If not, leave it. I didn't migrate, so I left the posts there.\n\nChange the intro to something to notify people to switch the profile they follow. This is technically optional, and you can just delete it if you feel like it. Delete the 'avatar' if you migrated posts (it's unneeded), but if you kept your posts there, then you'll want to keep it, as otherwise your old posts won't have an avatar (perhaps this is preferred?)\n\nFinally, we save up and go to sign/publish our changes. Visit each hub site (the actual site down at the bottom of zerohello, not zerome). Then drag the sidebar open and select 'i own this site'. Put your user content.json in the bottom box (should look something like: data/users/[yourid]/content.json) and hit sign. It'll prompt for a privatekey. Use your ZeroID private key (found at the top of your zeronet's user.json file) and then click publish. Do this for every hub you've edited.\n\n---\n\nSo now all of the changes are made and published. Everyone else should see everything just fine. But you might still be stuck logged into your old hub. So delete every hub but your destination hub. Then go into zerome and ensure you're logged in properly. Finally, redownload each hub and everything should be good to go!",

			"body": "Update on the login issue for KaffieID. The login code detects your cert name, which is the little `name@zeroid.bit` and then compares it to the one in your `content.json` file. If they match, it sets that as your user. If not, then it doesn't. So username switching systems, or people with matching names/providers (such as nanasi/kaffie that don't guarantee name uniqueness) you get login issues. And switching an id (even with the same auth keys and such) makes a login issue, despite signing working correctly anyway.\n\nApparently the only think you need to change is the content.json in your home hub, to fix this. just change `\"cert_user_id\": \"name@provider.bit\",` to whatever it is that is in the top right (your cert name). If this field is missing, there'll be issues. And if it doesn't match, there'll be issues.\n\nThe fix I posted below (changing the detection in all.js) to be based on auth_address) works as well, and lets you log in regardless (so if your signing is good, you're all set). Though amusingly, the little `name@provider.bit` that appears everywhere *is* based on that field in the content.json. Interesting...\n\nI'd still like the change to all.js to be made though, so that this issue doesn't occur. Having broken logins is never good.",

			"body": "So there's been signing/publishing issues issues with KaffieID and I seem to have found out why. When there's a cert_sign in the content.json, ZeroNet attempts to create a new cert to recreate the cert_sign to verify.\n\nHere's the relevant code:\n\n```\ndef verifyCert(self, inner_path, content):\n        from Crypt import CryptBitcoin\n\n        rules = self.getRules(inner_path, content)\n        if not rules.get(\"cert_signers\"):\n            return True  # Does not need cert\n\n        name, domain = content[\"cert_user_id\"].split(\"@\")\n        cert_address = rules[\"cert_signers\"].get(domain)\n        if not cert_address:  # Cert signer not allowed\n            self.log.error(\"Invalid cert signer: %s\" % domain)\n            return False\n        return CryptBitcoin.verify(\n            \"%s#%s/%s\" % (rules[\"user_address\"], content[\"cert_auth_type\"], name), cert_address, content[\"cert_sign\"]\n)\n```\n\nThis means that only certs that have signed using `useraddress#authtype/name` are valid. Which eliminates the ability to change names but keep the same cert. This verification requiring the name is entirely useless, and you can get around the entire issue by modifying the content.json to simply not have a cert_sign.\n\nSo... what should we do? Just force everyone to use the `useraddress#authtype/name` and hope that no one pushes out a cert that uses something different? KaffieID uses `useraddress#authtype/kaffie.bit` so that names can freely change. However, that seems to mess up the python verification. The cert works, it's just unexpected due to not using the name. Should I just change KaffieID to mess up certs when you change names? Seems kind of dumb that changing a name for an ID service would mess up your cert. I mean, we already have public/private keys. Is a specialized cert_sign in a particular format that breaks if you change names necessary?\n\nAlternatively we can look a bit further on what's actually going on behind the scenes, and perhaps fix it entirely? Perhaps certs should have a 'format' for the verification to take place?\n\n@nofish: I'm interested to see what you have to say. At the moment the cert_sign appears to me as a redundant check that breaks certs that use different formatting. Why not simply change the check to `useraddress#authtype/signersite`? Is there even a way to change this now that people have been using ZeroIDs? Would the 'format' option I described work?",

The big issue seems to be that there's no way to get the magnet link/torrent file from a video, meaning you can only ever seed it when you're on the page. And uploading is really glitchy, so if you use the direct thing, you're shit outta luck.\n\nI went ahead and mirrored some videos (Cosmos Laundromat, Fastcast vids, etc) as well as uploaded a new one of my own (Deadpool movie). For those who want to just manually upload stuff, here's my process:\n\n1. Drag/drop the movie into webtorrent. This is to start the seeding process. Don't include anything besides the mp4. Webms don't work, and I'm guessing stuff like AVIs don't work either.\n\n2. Right click on the newly seeded torrent and hit 'copy magnet link'. You'll paste this in the 'magnet' field on your data.json.\n\n3. Add a new video in your data.json. Here's the format:\n\n```\n{\n\"video_id\": \"\",\n\"title\": \"\",\n\"description\": \"\",\n\"magnet\": \"\",\n\"date_added\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\nFor 'video_id', it's expecting the bittorrent hash listed under 'bith'. It's in the magnet link near the beginning. For date_added, my new entries have the format `2016-08-29T02:12:14.588Z`. (Edit: You can use [this site](http://www.unixtimestamp.com/) to generate a timestamp. Use the 'ISO 8601' one.)\n\nHave fun. Still no way to increase the seeds besides manually sharing the magnet link and downloading through webtorrent (or staying on the page). You can grab a video's magnet link in the same manner. Alternatively you can grab the bith from the end of the watching URL, and paste that right into webtorrent desktop.\n\nAnd remember, the more support ZeroTube gets, the more webtorrents are seeded for *any* webtorrent video service.

And it also relies on the url to determine which hub your login/posts are in, which causes glitches (again, easy fix, just use the 'hub' variable in literally every hub data folder). That, and there's no 'migrate hub' button. Instead there's just a 'join hub', which deletes some data and such, and obviously that messes things up. It also doesn't switch the hub variable, or fix other things that could cause glitches.\n\nAfter those two things are fixed (in the ZeroMe site itself), then it should work fine. A ZeroMe clone could certainly be used for clean migrations. Amusingly, the old zerome would still support the migrated account, due to how things work.

And then compared to the one included in content.json (which is a copy of the one that the site provides). However, there's no guarantee the site will use said formula, and thus the publish is rejected despite having the private key correct.\n\nTo bypass this, you remove the auth_type and cert_sign provided in the content.json. Now that these are lacking, the cert_sign check is skipped and it just verifies that the private key was used and signed the stuff correctly.\n\nSo the cert_sign is entirely unneeded.

I think there's an SQL query somewhere that's used to fetch followed users, but includes userdb directory/listings. The site functioned normally otherwise: you could still follow people (just not see the list), the activity feed still worked fine, profiles worked, etc.\n\nI didn't want to fuss around with getting it to work, since I just wanted a quick zerome clone with a video focus. All in all, you could probably have a ZeroMe clone without that centralized list. Following would have to be reworked a bit, and obviously there wouldn't be a centralized list of users.

Sorry.\n\n@Shellbound: Unfortunately most of the music I listen to isn't available for streaming on 'normal' services (spotify/google/tidal/etc). A few borderline illegal chinese services have some though :P.\n\n@TeddyDD: MusicBrainz is one of those things that I like (it's a pretty solid system/software) but it's incredibly lacking in info and has no easy way of submitting my hundreds of tagged songs that aren't in the DB.\n\n@Lain: It's already *technically* usable. It's pretty slow though, and lacks a lot of features I want to put in it. Right now it's a streamer/downloader for two popular chinese music sites: Xiami and Netease Music. Here's some screenshots:\n\n[artist page](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmWDSYSh2cEzUpnyLD4cPSWHcrVbNyg398JgbySeirb72x) - Grabs all the albums available, along with last.fm and musicbrainz data. Similar artists shown at the top there.\n\n[search results](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmaM7XN67F2kpzRaveyKTQ7hqGXPRySacoPGKoE5nsKGJ5) - Pretty straight forward. Shows the search results of whatever you're looking for.\n\n[Album page+playing queued songs](https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmaicZJuVkMJgqQEZseVJY8uVp7kjKutqeUqMiQNrtSSF4) - Shows the tracks from both services, along with a variety of play/queue/download buttons. Has options to directly download a track or to download the whole album. The app automatically tags mp3s, and sorts into `artist/album/track.mp3`. Lyrics are obtained if available.\n\nI keep feeling like I should shift it over to QT or something, rather than have it a webapp. Since managing the queue and such is getting clunky (I redirect to a new player page, with an iframe of the viewed page, and then manage URL state directly). I use flask at the moment, which is why I'm getting a bit of lag between pages switches (has to load content from two different chinese sites, then manage the data, maybe grab more content, etc.). The downloading isn't perfect yet (no downloads from netease), the merging is still a mess. And there's no easy way to manage your catalogue. No importing/uploads/whatever, as it's just a stream+download tool at the moment. I want to throw in a thing to log the data viewed into a database of some sort. Initially I thought maybe sending that to a hosted DB somewhere would work, but I want users to have access to it, and to not have the DB swarmed. I made a crawler for Xiami, but I haven't written stuff for logging just yet. I've mostly just worked on it off/on for the past while now. Xiami changed things up mid-dev, so I had to spend a lot of time fixing it. And netease seems to constantly shift their cdn stuff, which makes it keep breaking.\n\n@Icf20: Looks like that's just ripping from youtube. Won't work for my purposes.\n\n@Johnhamelink: I've seen beets, and it seems like it grabs from the usual sources :\\\\. I haven't seen the mopidy stuff though. I'll have to look into it.",

Once that's done, I should be able to write a plugin for *any* music source that provides a few basic features (search, grab albums by artist, grab tracks by album, etc.) I was actually wondering if I could implement it with IPFS/ZeroNet, so that when people listen to tracks and dl info, it automatically adds it to zn/ipfs so that it's accessible even without the 3rd party sites.
