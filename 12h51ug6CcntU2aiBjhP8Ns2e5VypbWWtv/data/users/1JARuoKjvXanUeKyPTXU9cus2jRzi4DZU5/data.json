Could you reformulate? \n\nthe perfect example are european colonists that have stolen huge amount of land from native Americans if you want to be true to property when descendants get irrefutable proof  about land property they could get a claim on a land that currently a farmer in Minnesota use, if you have property put in a system (like bloackchain) where it cannot be reassigned by a judge/3rdparty and only the owner can resign the property then restitution is not longer possible and people who get a better claim on the property are not treated fair ",
