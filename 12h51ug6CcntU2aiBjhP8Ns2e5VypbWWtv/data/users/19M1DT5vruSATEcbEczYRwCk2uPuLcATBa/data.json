I didn't want to bother setting up a throwaway email to sign up for a Twitter account, etc.)  To make it interesting, I am going to allow users to create rules (which expire in a minute or two) to control the bot!",

Since it does, it triggers a loop where it infinitely notifies itself of any events.  I have patched my own MergerSitePlugin.py to forbid merging with self.",

After all the site rules specify that a certificate from zeroid.bit is required.   Line 719 in ContentManager.py (method 'verifyFile') seems to check for a valid certificate when one is required.  It is called from Site.py line 133 when new files are downloaded.  This seems like a bug.",

Also, 'name' is the part of cert_user_id that comes before the @ and you can set it to whatever you want as in auth_address@kaffie.bit .  \n\nAs far as I understand it, certificates are how ZeroNet makes pseudonyms convenient.  It has nothing to do with signing the user data.  The bug you found (props!) needs to be fixed, but certificates do play a useful role IMO.",

I know how to do this by merging with other types.  If someone made a site for conducting polls and designated it as a merged site, I could ask users for permission to merge, then get the data and maybe make widgets for displaying polls that ZeroMe users could add to posts.  At the moment, the only permissions for access to merger sites are 'none' and 'read-write'.  ",
