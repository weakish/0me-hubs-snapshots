The search results are skewed.\n\nHere is the proof, https://i.sli.mg/aiAa11.png\n\nhttps://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/12403#searchresult\n\nI came across this in the attachment during the Podesta leaks.  I use qwant.com or startpage , duckduckgo is compromised startpage just renders same results as google. qwant I don't knowledge exactly how it works, but I can some results that are blacklisted by google and other search engines. They must have their own crawler.",

			"body": "Public is just as bad as private if not worse. Quit reading the Guardian, or any mainstream media. Have you not read the wikileak emails, they are working directly for the governments or rich Isreali Americans as propaganda arms although slightly less than public media.\n\nFor my media, I read blogs and social media. Twitter is great, any big news organization manipulates their reporters and they are not free. I prefer the information straight from the people. You can find a lot of great material searching wordpress blogs and then rssing them. They are as good if not better than most \"respectable\" reporting.\n\nThis article and many others like it are just angry that the \"media\" lost control of the narrative and that people have direct access and power to report their own stories. Information no longer has to go via a institutional filter.\n\nWhy should anyone trust them or value their opinion when their track record this year has been deplorable?",
