On IPFS even a new version of the site is not the way you like it, you can switch back to a previous one.\n\nBut yes, dynamic sites are ZeroNet's feature. And IPFS is FS. But you say that as if that's bad. ZeroNet, for example, can't deal with big files, while I used to stream videos on my ZeroNet blog page using IPFS and HTML5.\n\nWhat I think, a union and collaboration is a way this things should work.",
