			"body": "This year I did some urban gardening on my balcony: at the end of June I sowed 3 × 2 cherry tomato seeds (since the seed bag told me to expect a germination rate at around 50%). All 6 seeds germinated, and I couldn't bear to murder 3 of the seedlings so I let all plants grow — somewhat crowded — in the same large pot. I then discovered that this kind of cherry tomatoes were meant for growing in a greenhouse, and since the summer in Denmark was quite cold this year I expected to harvest only a few tomatoes and perhaps have another few ripen by picking them and letting them sit in the windowsill.\nI was put to shame: I August we had 2-3 warm weeks and I have harvested at least 6 big handfuls of delicious cheery tomatoes. There are still a couple of handfuls left on the plants outside but they will have to ripen indoor as the temperatures are quite autumn'ish now.\nIt's been a good experience, so I'll probably grow tomatoes — and possibly other vegetables – again next year.",
