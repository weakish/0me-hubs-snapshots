			"body": "That is a nightmare. I haven't used Dell in ages since they never had the specs I needed in my price range, so I had two HP laptops. First one was a gift, second one I bought myself. Funny enough, both had the same issue of the hinge breaking and the screen starting to fail, despite being completely different models built years apart from each other. It happened to the second one even faster than it did the first. Throwing numerous other small issues I had with both into the mix, and I've sworn off ever buying another HP laptop again.\n\nI'm now using a Lenovo y50-70. I've had zero issues with the hardware besides the slow SSHD that it shipped with, but that has since been replaced by a 1TB SSD. Other than that it's worked great, except for the fact that I'm stuck using Windows on it because of the graphics software I need to use :P  So I haven't tried installing Linux on it myself, but from what I've read of others experience people have gotten distros like Ubuntu working fine.",
