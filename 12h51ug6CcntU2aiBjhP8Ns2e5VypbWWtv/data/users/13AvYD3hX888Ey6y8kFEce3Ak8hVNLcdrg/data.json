Like in so many open source areas, people should work together. \nI would love to shift phones more in a Pc direction so you can install the OS you want on them. But when I see that drivers for most of the components are closed of by the manufacturer we have a long way to go.\nMy solution at the moment is to run Cyanogenmod with only the essential google services and using f-Droit whenever possible.",

I felt instead of giving me more features they they dumped everything down. Tried it on my old hardware, went out bought a cheap ultrabook for less than half the price and put Linux on it.
