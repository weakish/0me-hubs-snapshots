			"body": "@<tkarita/>: I think the fact that many projects require strict formatting standards on C code points to the problem of readability in C. It is nice that code formatters are available but I would argue that they are more necessary in C, than in python. And if you're talking about code snippets in python, I think most IDEs handle that quite well. I use snippets in Vim and Atom, both don't really have a problem with Python..\n\nI don't understand why delimiters are more readable than indentation. To me, enforced indentation is a way to be certain of which scope you're in. With braces, you have to trace every brace until you find which level you're in. Seems rather inefficient.",

It makes it harder to process, sure, but it is inevitable when there are no strict rules.",
