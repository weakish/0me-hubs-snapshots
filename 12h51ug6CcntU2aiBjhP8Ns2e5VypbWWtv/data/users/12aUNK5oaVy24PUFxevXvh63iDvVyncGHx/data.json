			"body": "@<tkarita/>: I think the fact that many projects require strict formatting standards on C code points to the problem of readability in C. It is nice that code formatters are available but I would argue that they are more necessary in C, than in python. And if you're talking about code snippets in python, I think most IDEs handle that quite well. I use snippets in Vim and Atom, both don't really have a problem with Python..\n\nI don't understand why delimiters are more readable than indentation. To me, enforced indentation is a way to be certain of which scope you're in. With braces, you have to trace every brace until you find which level you're in. Seems rather inefficient.",
