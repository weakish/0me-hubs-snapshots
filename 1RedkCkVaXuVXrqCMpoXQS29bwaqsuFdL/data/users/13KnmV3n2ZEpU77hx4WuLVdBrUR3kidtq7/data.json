I couldn't get it to run for me, but if you are using it regualarly, you could host some of its artworks on a site here and link to the code. This way you'd increase zeronet content, and you show off some of your software's results, potentially making people curious to try it out.",

I know tor is not meant for torrenting, but as far as I know i2p support is wip. I2P does have it's own torrent clients, but I think I'm thinking in terms of integration. I guess that's overkill, right? Because copy pasting a magnet link should not be to much work for anybody, right? I guess what bothered me was that I am anon in zn, but can'T get the torrents in an anon fashion without installing additional software @nobite",
