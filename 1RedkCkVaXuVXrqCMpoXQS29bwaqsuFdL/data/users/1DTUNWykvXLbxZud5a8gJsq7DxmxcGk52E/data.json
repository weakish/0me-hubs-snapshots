What am I doing wrong here? I can usually get webtorrent content to stream through Firefox. My error says \"it appears to be taking longer than usual, possibly lacks peers.\"  ",

If more people do this, then your demo content will be available 24/7 because my PC is on 75% of the time with Webtorrent running.",

			"body": "This is a really cool idea. I wonder if someone could adapt the your work to create a multimedia \"Facebook\" experience for ZeroNet. All content on a person's page could be webtorrent seeds that play albums, videos, and music when selected. A totally decentralized social media platform would be exciting. Not to get ahead of myself, but I dont' have any idea how you could control permissions on such a page so that those outside of your network can not view content you don't want them to see. ",
