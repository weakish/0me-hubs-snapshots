The peer is following the common rules.\n2. The peer has given out information that can reliably imply what we want it to have.\n\nExample: Decentralized CAPTCHA\n1. The peer is generating legit CAPTCHAs. It is not generating random, illegible noises. It is not reusing old CAPTCHAs.\n2. Solving the CAPTCHA using a computer is hard, but checking the answer is easy. In this way, giving out the answer implies that a real human being, rather than spammer bots, is writing a post. Everyone can effectively conclude that, because it is easy to check the validity of an answer.\n\nProblem with a Decentralized CAPTCHA idea on ZeroTalk:\n1.

			"body": "An Open Question to Every ZeroNet Contributor\n\n## How to maintain a reasonable balance between storage availability and data availability, using algorithms?\n\n(Updated)\n\nWhen I read the homepage of bit.no.com, the ZeroNet proxy, I noticed that the proxy found more peers than my own ZeroNet client did. When I clicked on my ZeroMux website to see the peers bit.no.com found, I saw many points that I could not find on my own map. I believe that those extra points were computers that were no longer reachable. (Correction: peer list is updated every 1~4 hours)\n\nSeveral days ago, the owner of https://onlyzero.net/ , a ZeroNet proxy, received a takedown complaint from a Hong Kong company, forcing the site owner to take down a software cracking site hosted on the proxy. This complaint is the first takedown complaint that makes us be aware of peer reliability in ZeroNet.\n\nZeroNet chooses which optional file to recycle according to the number of peers the file has. ZeroNet may have included the peers that are \"dead,\" unreachable and very slow, or have other incorrect assumptions on peer reliability. To make a more accurate calculation, ZeroNet's corresponding algorithm should apply a weight to every peer.\n\n### How to define the weight?\nConcerns:\n- We cannot rely on peers that are \"dead,\" slow and unlikely to **contribute**.\n- We cannot rely too much on **major seeders**. When someone tries to take down certain content, he or she will take down the major seeders first.\n\nAspects to take in, including but not limited to:\n- **Connectivity:** the \"ping\" value of a peer __(but adds to data transfer)__; the speed a peer __(but has insufficient data)__; the ratio of the number of successful connections to the number of all connections made __(requires bigger sample size)__.\n- **Contribution:** recent contributions of a peer, observed by ZeroNet itself. __(but varies with respect to network environment)__.\n\nMathematical Fairness:\n- Since we cannot rely too much on major seeders, the weight should not be greater than 1. This cut off avoids over-evaluating big seeding peers.\n- Since ZeroNet evaluates data availability based on its observation of its own network environment, ZeroNet may run into some false positives. We should also find a way to cross validate evaluations. (Hard)\n\n### Viability\nThe weight defined above requires a lot of information, and it is costly to gather all these information only to calculate weights. Perhaps we can take a more heuristic approach, at the beginning, assuming all peers has a weight of 0.9, and changing the weight value when latest information is available.\n\nThis algorithm may be too strict and paranoid, but this algorithm can be helpful when there are disruptions targeting the ZeroNetwork going on.",
