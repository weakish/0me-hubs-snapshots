I wanted to abuse it to shove a simplified Kaffiene search in there, but it doesn't really work all that great. \n\nMy tests worked somewhat, but entering a larger DB seemed to make the search lag out. There's also no easy way of sorting by rank. There's the possibility of abusing the date display, but I can't seem to make it display things newer than 'now'. And even then, it's not clean. And the actual searching itself isn't really that great. So much for that idea.\n\nOn the bright side, I did learn a lot about how databases worked on ZeroNet though, so that's a plus.",

I initially fixed it by making blue hub's data.json just `{}` and pushing that. It worked, but it worked because I hadn't commented on a blue post.\n\nApparently, ZeroMe updates my blue hub comments in my blue hub folder, not my red hub. This is why my manually edited comment didn't show up, I put it in the red hub data.json. So it showed in the sidebar, but not on the post itself.\n\nTo fix, all I had to do was delete the data.json, and clear it out of the content.json, and sign+publish. It auto re-created the blue hub data.json with the proper posts. I then manually edited in the original glitched comment (and removed it from red hub) and everything's now working fine.\n\n@nofish, is this the intended feature, or is my profile glitched somehow?",

But I do know that you can't sign it without the user's cert. And to get that, you have to ask them to sign in, and have them explicitly agree to let the site sign stuff on their behind. No login = no damage.\n\nUnless you can somehow manage to get the user's public and private key without their consent. But even then, you'd have to do every possible ID site, otherwise your thing could be thwarted with a nanasi/kaffie/zeroverse id.\n\nBut yes, once your site has access to their public and private key (only possible on your own site's data, or merged hub data) then you can modify it. For a good example, look at the ZeroMe clones. They can't touch your stuff (or even show it to you) until you select your cert and log in.",

ZeroNet provides an authaddress and private key for each individual site for the user. This allows you to make unique IDs, or to switch authaddress/key to an ID site and match your cert. This lets you sign stuff on the site. To maliciously attack someone's zerome data, you'd have to have them select the cert they use on zerome on your site, so that you can use it to sign/modify their data (just as any merger site/zerome clone would).",
