And for those worrying about censorship, I'm pretty sure there will be plenty of people willing to seed the NSFW hubs :)\n\nThe other benefit to having the torrents in hubs is that it emphasizes the fact that anybody could create their own torrent site front-end and then tap into the same hubs. This also solves the issues that some sites like ZeroTorrent have had where a user would run out of their allowed space on the site preventing them from making more uploads. With a hub system the user could simply switch to a different hub and continue uploading without having to hope that the creator of whatever site will up the user space allotment.",

Just store one virtualdisk file on one drive, store the other on another drive, mount both of them, format LVM and then combine! \n\nSure you can generally expand a virtualdisk file if you run out of space, but then you have to deal with the existing partitions and whether the one you want bigger is easily enlarged, and you're also stuck with a single massive multi-gigabyte file to deal with as well.",

That flooding meant other people who posted things would have trouble getting their posts noticed unless they were already established users and had followers. If you want to make a daily post of all the torrents you've added to ZeroTorrent that's fine. You can make it really long and it won't bother anyone or push other posts. But flooding ZeroMe with individual posts for every torrent you want to share is very rude.\n\nAnd yes that's my opinion, but the whole point of Zeronet is that we can express our opinions right?
