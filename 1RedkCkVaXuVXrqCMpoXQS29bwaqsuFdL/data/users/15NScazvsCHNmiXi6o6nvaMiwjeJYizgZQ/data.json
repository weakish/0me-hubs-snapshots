It's somewhat unfortunate, partly because some people were/are using his ZeroVerse ID+Mail services, partly because Erkan has squatted a lot of zero*.bit domains, and of course also because Erkan had many good intentions for ZeroNet.\n>\n>Well, we can't force people how to spend their energy, so instead of moaning the fact that Erkan has left ZeroNet, let's try to be practical. I, for one, will stop seeding all of Erkan's zites and stop using ZeroVerse Mail+ID. I suggest you guys do the same.

Plus making backups with LVM should also be easier.\n\nIt may be not needed sometimes - on a notebook, for example. But when it comes to PC, LVM seems a very nice idea. For example, I would make a raid-like volume for my data (may be 3 HDD for important things - LVM is very agile), and spread the rest of the data between 3 HDD without mirroring. And the great part is that it would be only 1 LVM partition on each LVM - and I would NEVER need to change their sizes with any parted or gdisk, I would never be afraid to loose my data - LVM promise that they handle it with care.\n\nIt is not the most important thing one could imagine - yes.. But it is a cool thing non the less.\n\nToo bad it's so hard for me to set it up on Arch and that Windows does not have native support of it (but then windows also does not support ext4...).\n\n(Sorry, too much text, to few things I actually wrote about...
