How do you know that a site you want to visit is not running a malicious script?  I think I remember @nofish hinting that in a future version of ZeroNet, you will be able to download a site and take a look at the code before running it.  Still, how do you know that a site owner won't update the code to add something malicious?  One solution to this is to extend ZeroNet to ask for confirmation before updating certain files.  Take ZeroMe for example.  This feature might ignore all updates to user content, but if one of the core site files like all.js changes, it would notify you of the new SHA512 of the file and ask if you want to update.  You could then ask around to see if the update is legit and confirm the hash before updating.\n\nConcerning implementation, a ZeroTalk clone could certainly take off if there is enough demand.  However, there are certain things like payments, feedback, organizing listings, etc. that one wants to optimize in a marketplace.  So I think it is a good idea to hold off and try to build a new app.  \n\nThe DIY swapmeet structure is what I have in mind.  I envision large hubs with many users.  Hub owners could set rules for which stores may operate on their hub.  For example, if I ran a hub I would forbid my stores from selling anything connected to violence like assassinations, child porn and sex slavery, etc.  (One property of this system would be that since I could not see what my users were buying, it would not be possible to filter them.)  Reputable hubs could even charge a small fee to stores for a certificate from the hub.  \n\nThere are economic ways to deal with scamming.  Any ZeroNet marketplace would have to have a reputation system.  There is a lot of academic research on the best ways to set up such a system.  I am thinking about whether it is workable to have sellers offer buyers a rebate if they leave feedback.  Anyway, a seller with no reputation or with a bad reputation would probably offer goods at a lower price to offset the risk.  Then as their reputation improved they could begin to charge a premium for their brand.\n\n> bitcoin multisig is a hassle for most people\nThis is another reason to set up a marketplace app instead of adapting something like ZeroTalk.  It is possible to construct a multisig wallet in JavaScript.  So when a user wants to buy something, they start by picking their escrow agent (listed by reputation/fee or something) from a list.  Then a script on the page generates a 2-of-3 wallet, gives the user their signing key, and they fund it.  (Assumption: ZeroNet marketplace users can send cryptocurrency to a cryptocurrency address.)

It is great if they are intrigued enough to remember it when they get home, but they might need to experience it first before they get that excited.  Maybe it is enough to experience using a throwaway account on a proxy for the first session.  Maybe the user starts running a ZeroNet peer.  Then what do they do if they want to use ZeroNet when they are out?  Only a small subset of the people who would find ZeroNet interesting enough to use would be also willing to learn how and set up one of the excellent solutions that all of my technically inclined friends here have suggested.  Everyone else is stuck using ZeroNet at home on their desktop.  Ultimately I think this is bad for ZeroNet.",

If it becomes efficient to produce formal correctness proofs for large classes of useful programs, that will certainly change the computing landscape.  I'm not so worried about the quality of Tesla software.  I trust people to act based on a some kind of internal risk model.  How successful Tesla will be ultimately depends on (in one dimension) how reliable and secure their software is versus how much value their products bring to people.  Also, if they fuck up the software so that remote operators can brick their cars, for example, that might spell the end of the company.  In that case, the next fancy high-tech car company would probably then spend correspondingly more time and money hardening their software.  People who appreciate the risks can simply avoid buying a Tesla.  It would also be nice if there were various road operators whose diverse policies made it possible to avoid sharing the road with a Tesla if they were thought to be unsafe.  Military drones that are built to kill are abominable.  I have long stopped identifying as a US citizen because of the evils of the US government.  It is chilling to even think along the lines of automated target acquisition, although that is under active development.  The last thing the individuals of the world should want is to build a totally reliable war engine that can be efficiently controlled by a small group of people.  ",
