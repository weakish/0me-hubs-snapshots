I mean why do we read this from the regular news and not from ZeroNet itself?\n\nRemember there is a big anti-encryption debate going on, and some have it in their interests to discredit projects like ZeroNet, Telegram and Tor.\n\nReligious fundamentalists does not care about states, all rules and countries are made by God, and their normal terror group names sound all high and mighty like The al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades.\n\nBut for some reason the Islamic State group based it's name on the Western fright scenario instead of their own religious motives.
