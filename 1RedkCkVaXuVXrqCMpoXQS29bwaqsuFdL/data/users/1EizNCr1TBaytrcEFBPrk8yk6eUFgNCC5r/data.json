			"body": "@Talnicrom: Honestly, the simplest way is hosting a proxy for yourself. You could have your home PC act as one. You need to forward the port so that requests from the outside (on that particular port) will reach the computer running the ZeroNet node. Also you have to bind ZeroNet to your gateway (or to just 0.0.0.0 if you want to bind it to all gateways). Setting a password (which ZeroNet client already supports) or some other kind of authentication is also a good idea.  \n  \n  \n(you could probably do the same with equivalent IPv6 addresses)",
