Over the last 2 days I've swapped out a bunch of different other parts:\n\n - I'm using lemonbuddy with a better fork of lemonbar for my upper bar now - I found both on the Arch User Repository.\n - I switched to stalonetray from trayer and found a fork that would work with my dual screen setup on the Arch User Repository.\n - I installed the infinality bundle which made a huge difference to font rendering.\n - I found a _really_ nice weechat config in someone else's dotfiles and merged it with my config\n - I discovered a really nice dmenu replacement called rofi. I'm planning on using it for some custom code which will hopefully emulate Dash on OSX.\n\nI'm loving the change and I really like bspwm now too! It feels much more responsive and lighter than Awesome.\n\n - [Desktop](https://u.teknik.io/q7E98.png)\n - [Weechat](https://u.teknik.io/JGxxu.png)\n - [Rofi](https://u.teknik.io/lQaz5.png)\n\nIf you're into this kinda stuff I'd recommend lurking around on Reddit's [/r/unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn) subreddit.
