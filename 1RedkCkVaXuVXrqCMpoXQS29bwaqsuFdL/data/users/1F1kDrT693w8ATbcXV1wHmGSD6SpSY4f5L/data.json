The UI/UX was very innovative though and I really wish that they would let Android apps at least run in some shape or form on the OS, because right now there aren't enough apps for me to go \"yep, switching to this\" at all.  Maybe if they made it easier to port?  Last time I tried making an app it took me twice the time that it would usually do for an Android device, though that was probably due to the fact that I was still getting used to everything (SDK layout, functions etc)",
